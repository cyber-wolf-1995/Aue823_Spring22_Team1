Contains the final code for AuE823_Final project demos.
There are 3 main launch files:
1) turtlebot3_auonomybackup.launch to run the scripts coded for Gazebo simulation
2) turtlebot3_real.launch that runs the scripts for the real world turtlebot demo

Codes were first developed for Gazebo and then tweaked for the real world scenario hence two different scripts for gazebo and real world.
